# FIREBASE STORAGE RULES - COPY THIS EXACTLY

## STEP 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/gereuonlinehub/storage/rules
2. Delete ALL existing rules
3. Copy and paste this EXACT code:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click "Publish"

## STEP 2: If Rules Don't Work - Use This Alternative

If updating the rules doesn't work, the issue might be with your Firebase project configuration. Try this:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/gereuonlinehub/settings/general
2. Check if Storage is enabled
3. If not enabled, click "Get started" to enable Firebase Storage

## STEP 3: Emergency Bypass

If Firebase Storage still doesn't work, I've created a local fallback system that will store images locally instead of uploading to Firebase.
